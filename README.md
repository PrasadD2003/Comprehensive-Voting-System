#  Comprehensive Voting System with User Authentication and Role-Based Access 🗳️📊🔐🔑

## 📄 Project Overview

The **Voting System** project addresses the need for secure and efficient voting solutions in diverse environments, such as corporate settings, student organizations, and public institutions. This system allows administrators to create and manage multiple voting rounds, oversee user accounts, and view real-time results, while offering participants a simple interface to cast their votes.

Key features include user authentication, ensuring only authorized users can manage voting processes, and data persistence, allowing for the secure storage and retrieval of voting and user data. The system supports distinct user roles, with administrators handling management tasks and participants casting votes. With functionalities like vote counting and result display, the Voting System guarantees transparency, accuracy, and fairness throughout the voting process.


## 🌟 Features

- 🔒User Authentication: Secure authentication for administrators and participants.
- 🗂️Voting Rounds Management: Dynamic creation and deletion of voting rounds.
- 🗳️ Vote Casting: Users can cast votes and view results for different rounds.
- 🛠️ Data Persistence: User and voting data is stored and retrieved securely across sessions.
- 👥Role-based Access: Administrators can manage users and voting rounds, while participants can vote and view results.
- 📊Real-Time Results: Live tracking and display of vote counts.

## 🛠️ Components

### 1. 🗳️Vote Component (Vote.java)
 - Manages the core functionality of recording and displaying votes for different options within a voting round.
- Stores vote options and their respective counts.
- Provides methods for vote counting and displaying results.

### 2. 🗂️VoteSystem Component (VoteSystem.java)
- Manages the entire voting system, including user authentication, voting rounds, and result computation.
- Handles user management with methods like authenticateUser(), addUser(), and deleteUser().
- Controls voting processes via the voteOnTopics() method and serves as the entry point of the application.

### 3.  👥 User Management
- Admins can securely manage user accounts using methods like addUser() and deleteUser().
- Default admin credentials are preloaded, with support for dynamic user addition/deletion and persistence of user data.

### 4.  🔄 Voting Rounds Management
- Admins can create and delete voting rounds dynamically with methods like startNewVotingRound() and deleteVotingRound().
- Voting rounds are persisted across sessions, ensuring data retention even after restarting the system.


### 5.  📊 Voting and Results Display
- Users can cast votes through the voteOnTopics() method.
- Real-time results are displayed using the viewResults() method, showing vote counts for each option.
- Multiple voting in the same round is prevented to maintain the integrity of the voting process.


### 6.  🔒 Data Persistence and Security
- The system employs file-based storage using serialization (users.dat, votes.dat) to persist user and voting data.
- Secure storage mechanisms ensure the protection of sensitive data such as user credentials.
